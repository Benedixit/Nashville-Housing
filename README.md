# Nashville-Housing
This dataset for this project was derived from Kaggle. The project itself was aimed at finding certain information about housing as evidenced in the dataset in the query. Some of the concept learnt included the derivation of column name using a special type of query as well as finding the data type of a column. I also learnt how to handle the “Msg 8115, Level 16, State 2, Line 34
Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int.” error
